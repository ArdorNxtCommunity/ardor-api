# Forging

In Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms, Forging is the process of building and validating transaction blocks, which equivalent to Mining in Proof-of-Work, with the exception that forgers are rewarded only from transaction fees and there is no new generation of forging coin (ARDR is this case).
