# Introduction
Welcome to the Ardor Blockchain-as-a-Service platform API documentation.
This documentation is intended for developers from all horizons who want to explore with Ardor platform, build Decentrealized Applications (Dapps), leverage and integrate their own solutions to a public blockchain with huge flexibility like Ardor.

All the interactions with Ardor blockchain are done using HTTP requests and the responses are delivered as JSON objects. Thus, Ardor API can be used universally with any langage of your choice. In the what follows, `shell` and `Javascript` langages will be used to demonstrate the usage of the API, but other sdks are in development.

If you want to interactivally test the API with more recent blockchain data, we recommend you to:

1. Download the Ardor wallet [here](https://www.ardorplatform.org/)
2. Follow the installation instructions
3. Launch the Ardor wallet (can bee found as Ardor Server too on Windows) and wait for the wallet to sync
4. Go to http://localhost:27876/test
5. Scroll to the call you want to test, set the call parameters and explore the results on the side


# Authentication (Only for test)

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens (Only for test)

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json

  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
